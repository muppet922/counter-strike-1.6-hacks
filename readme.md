## Who's responsible for my VACaction? I am safe?

Sure not. I am not **responsible** if you get get banned by VAC, sXe, myac, gameguard or whatever anticheat bans you.

Here's a trick. If you want to cheat on public gameservers, just write in launch options -insecure. This disable VAC and you can use the cheats without stress.

## VIRUS!!!! wyd.

Indeed, russian spy's everywhere. Some of the .exe (if not all) triggers your anti-virus. It's a false-positive announce, nothing to worry about. If you are really paranoid, use sandbox and virustotal, or any methods available.


Althought, models, config files, sound files, rc files are 99% clean, if they don't use C++, but also the rest of 1% is a false-positive.
